## **Plan for Generating Requirements**

The objective is to create a comprehensive set of layered requirements by analyzing the provided Go source code. We will treat the code, especially the tests, as the definitive "source of truth" for the system's behavior and design.

The process will be broken down into three phases, corresponding to each requirements layer.

---

### **Phase 1: L1 \- Functional Requirements ("The What")**

This phase focuses on defining the system's core mission and user-facing features from an external perspective.

* **Goal**: To document *what* the service does for its clients.
* **Key Source Files**:
    * routing\_handlers.go: Defines the public HTTP API contract.
    * routing\_e2e\_test.go: Describes the primary "user story" of sending a message, having it stored offline, and then retrieving it.
    * fullflow\_test.go: Clarifies the service's role in the broader ecosystemâ€”routing opaque, encrypted messages without inspecting their contents.
* **Key Questions to Answer**:
    1. What is the service's primary mission?
    2. What are the core features it offers (e.g., message ingestion, offline storage, message retrieval)?
    3. What are the specific API endpoints, their expected inputs (HTTP methods, headers, body), and their successful outputs?
    4. What is the complete lifecycle of a message sent to an offline user?

### **Phase 2: L2 \- Architectural Requirements ("The How")**

This phase focuses on the underlying design principles, constraints, and non-functional qualities of the system.

* **Goal**: To document the fundamental rules and patterns that govern the system's design.
* **Key Source Files**:
    * interfaces\_routing.go: The clearest expression of the service's modularity and separated concerns.
    * service\_routing.go & routingservice.go: Show the assembly of components, especially the pipeline architecture.
    * All \*\_test.go files: Demonstrate the system's high degree of testability.
* **Key Questions to Answer**:
    1. What is the dominant architectural pattern? (A message processing pipeline).
    2. How does the system achieve loose coupling and modularity? (Provider Abstraction via interfaces).
    3. What are the key non-functional requirements? (Asynchronous processing, resiliency to transient errors, concurrency via pipeline workers, and high testability using emulators).
    4. How are operations made safe and reliable? (Use of Firestore Transactions for atomic writes in firestore.go).

### **Phase 3: L3 \- Technical Requirements ("The Specifics")**

This phase documents the concrete technologies, configuration schemas, and data structures that must be implemented.

* **Goal**: To specify *exactly what* technologies and data formats are used.
* **Key Source Files**:
    * runroutingservice.go: Shows the final assembly of concrete dependencies and configuration from environment variables.
    * firestore.go & producer\_pubsub.go: Name the specific Google Cloud services used.
    * config\_routing.go & types\_routing.go: Define the configuration and data model structs.
* **Key Questions to Answer**:
    1. Which specific cloud services are required? (Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Firestore).
    2. What is the application's configuration schema (e.g., environment variables, topic/subscription names)?
    3. What are the precise data structures for domain models (ConnectionInfo, DeviceToken) and the on-the-wire format (SecureEnvelope)?
    4. What is the database schema (e.g., Firestore collection and document paths)?

The final output will be three distinct markdown documents: L1\_Functional\_Requirements.md, L2\_Architectural\_Requirements.md, and L3\_Technical\_Requirements.md.
